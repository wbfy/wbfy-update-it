# Update It! Automatic Update Plugin For WordPress

## Synopsis
WordPress is a great CMS but some of the default settings are – for good reason – quite cautious. One issue I had was having to constantly login and update customers websites to the latest plugin and theme versions,

WordPress itself provides the functionality to automatically update these things, but setting it up requires editing the code for each site which can be a bit of a headache.

And so Update It! was born. It’s a simple plugin that allows granular control WordPress automatic updates that doesn’t require any coding or access to the underlying WordPress code.

## Usage And Installation
